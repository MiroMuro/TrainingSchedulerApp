# Training scheduler app for private trainers.
CRUD capabilities of customers and their scheduled trainigs. Also includes a calendar for easier tracking of dates and trainigs. Customer data is avaible for export in the .CSV format.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and further developed with the [React MUI tools](https://mui.com/)

The customer and training API is provided by Haaga-Helia and can be accessed at http://traineeapp.azurewebsites.net/api/trainings/
Unfortunately my school has lost further documentation of the API.

## Available Scripts
